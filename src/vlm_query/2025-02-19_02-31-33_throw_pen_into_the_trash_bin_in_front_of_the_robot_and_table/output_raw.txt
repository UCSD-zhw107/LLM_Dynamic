### Step 1: Decomposing the task into stages

The task is to throw the pen into the trash bin. This involves the following stages:

1. **Grasp the pen**: The robot needs to pick up the pen from the table.
2. **Move and reorient the pen to a suitable pose to initiate the throw**: The robot needs to position the pen in a way that allows for an effective throw.
3. **Swing the arm outward at high speed and release the pen at the desired speed and position to make it fall into the trash bin**: The robot must execute a dynamic throwing motion to ensure the pen follows a parabolic trajectory into the trash bin.

---

### Step 2: Defining constraints

#### **Stage 1: Grasp the pen**
- **Sub-goal constraint**: The end-effector must align with the pen (keypoint 4).

#### **Stage 2: Move and reorient the pen to a suitable pose to initiate the throw**
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  1. The pen must be aligned with the intended throwing direction.
  2. The end-effector must be positioned in a way that allows for an effective throwing motion (e.g., slightly curled inward to prepare for the throw).
- **Path constraint**:
  1. The robot must still be grasping the pen.

#### **Stage 3: Swing the arm outward at high speed and release the pen at the desired speed and position**
- **Sub-goal constraints**:
  1. The pen must be released at a calculated position along a parabolic trajectory, ensuring it falls into the trash bin accurately.
  2. The pen must be thrown at a 45-degree upward angle.
  3. The pen must be released at a calculated velocity along a parabolic trajectory, ensuring it falls into the trash bin accurately.
- **Path constraints**:
  1. The robot must still be grasping the pen.
  2. The pen should remain aligned with the intended throwing direction during execution.

---

### Step 3: Summarizing keypoints to be grasped and released

- **Grasp keypoints**: The robot should grasp keypoint `4` (pen) in stage 1.
- **Release keypoints**: The robot should release keypoint `4` at the end of stage 3.
