**Step 1: Decompose the task into stages/subtasks**

**Stage 1: Grasp the hammer**

- **Sub-goal constraint:**
  - Align the end-effector with the hammer handle (keypoint[2]).
- **Path constraints:**
  - None.

**Stage 2: Move the hammer to a suitable pose to initiate the strike**

- **Sub-goal constraints:**
  - Position the hammer head (keypoint[4]) at a suitable distance from the apple (keypoint[0]) to initiate the swing.
  - Ensure the hammer head (keypoint[4]) is aligned with the intended swinging direction towards the apple (keypoint[0]).
- **Path constraints:**
  - The robot must still be grasping the hammer handle (keypoint[2]).

**Stage 3: Swing robot arm and hit the apple with the hammer head at desired speed and position**

- **Sub-goal constraints:**
  - The hammer head (keypoint[4]) should make contact with the apple (keypoint[0]) at impact.
  - The hammer head should have a desired impact velocity towards the apple at the moment of contact.
- **Path constraints:**
  - The robot must still be grasping the hammer handle (keypoint[2]).
  - The hammer head (keypoint[4]) remains aligned with the intended swinging direction during the swing.

**Reasoning about the dynamic system:**

- **Stage 1:** The robot moves its end-effector to grasp the hammer handle, aligning with keypoint[2].
- **Stage 2:** The robot positions the hammer to initiate the swing, ensuring the hammer head is at a suitable distance from the apple and aligned correctly.
- **Stage 3:** The robot swings the hammer, ensuring that at the moment of impact:
  - The hammer head contacts the apple.
  - The hammer head has sufficient velocity towards the apple to achieve the desired impact.

**Calculations and Equations:**

- **Position of the hammer head:**
  - `hammer_head_pose = eef_pose + (keypoints[4] - keypoints[2])`
- **Alignment constraint:**
  - `hammer_vector = keypoints[4] - keypoints[2]`
  - `swing_direction = keypoints[0] - hammer_head_pose`
  - `cos(theta) = (hammer_vector ¡¤ swing_direction) / (||hammer_vector|| * ||swing_direction||)`
- **Velocity constraint:**
  - Assume `hammer_head_velocity ¡Ö eef_velocity`
  - `velocity_towards_apple = eef_velocity ¡¤ (swing_direction_unit_vector)`
  - Ensure `velocity_towards_apple >= v_desired`

**Grasp and Release Keypoints:**

- **Grasp Keypoints:** `[2, -1, -1]` (grasp hammer handle in Stage 1)
- **Release Keypoints:** `[-1, -1, -1]` (no release needed for this task)
