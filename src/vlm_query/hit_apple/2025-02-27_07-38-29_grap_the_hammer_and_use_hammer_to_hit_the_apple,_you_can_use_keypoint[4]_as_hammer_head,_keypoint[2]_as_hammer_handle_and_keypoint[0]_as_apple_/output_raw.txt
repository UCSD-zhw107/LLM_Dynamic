# Solution

**Step 1: Decompose the task into stages**

1. **Stage 1**: Grasp the hammer handle.
    - Sub-goal constraint:
        - Align the end-effector with the hammer handle (keypoint[2]).
    - Path constraints:
        - None.

2. **Stage 2**: Move the hammer to a suitable pose to hit the apple.
    - Sub-goal constraints:
        - The hammer head (keypoint[4]) needs to be 10 cm above the apple (keypoint[0]) along the z-axis.
        - The hammer should be aligned vertically to ensure a straight downward swing.
    - Path constraints:
        - The robot must still be grasping the hammer handle (keypoint[2]).

3. **Stage 3**: Swing the hammer to hit the apple.
    - Sub-goal constraints:
        - The hammer head (keypoint[4]) must contact the apple (keypoint[0]).
        - The hammer head must have sufficient velocity towards the apple at the moment of impact.
    - Path constraints:
        - The robot must still be grasping the hammer handle (keypoint[2]).
        - The hammer head must remain aligned with the intended swinging direction throughout the motion.

**Step 2: Reasoning the dynamic system and writing constraints**

- For the grasping stage, ensure the end-effector is aligned with the hammer handle.
- For moving the hammer, position the hammer head above the apple and align it vertically.
- For swinging the hammer, ensure the hammer head impacts the apple with sufficient velocity.
- Throughout manipulation, ensure the robot continues grasping the hammer handle.

**Constraints:**

- **Stage 1 Sub-goal Constraint:**
    - Align end-effector with hammer handle (keypoint[2]).

- **Stage 2 Sub-goal Constraints:**
    - Hammer head (keypoint[4]) is 10 cm above apple (keypoint[0]) along the z-axis.
    - Hammer is aligned vertically (hammer vector is parallel to z-axis).

- **Stage 2 Path Constraint:**
    - Robot must still be grasping hammer handle (keypoint[2]).

- **Stage 3 Sub-goal Constraints:**
    - Hammer head (keypoint[4]) contacts apple (keypoint[0]).
    - Hammer head has sufficient velocity towards apple at impact.

- **Stage 3 Path Constraints:**
    - Robot must still be grasping hammer handle (keypoint[2]).
    - Hammer head remains aligned with swinging direction throughout motion.

**Grasp and Release Keypoints:**

- `grasp_keypoints`: `[2, -1, -1]` (grasp hammer handle in stage 1).
- `release_keypoints`: `[-1, -1, -1]` (no release needed).

# Explanation of how many stages are involved in the task and what each stage is about.

The task involves **3 stages**:

1. **Stage 1**: Grasp the hammer handle (`keypoint[2]`).
2. **Stage 2**: Move the hammer to a suitable pose to hit the apple.
3. **Stage 3**: Swing the hammer to hit the apple.
