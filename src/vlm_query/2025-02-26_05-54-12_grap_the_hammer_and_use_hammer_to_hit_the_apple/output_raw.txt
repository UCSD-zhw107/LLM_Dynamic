### Step 1: Decomposing the task into stages

The task consists of two main stages:

1. **Grasp the hammer**  
   - The robot needs to align its end-effector with the hammer handle and grasp it.

2. **Swing the hammer to hit the apple**  
   - The robot needs to move the hammer to a suitable position to initiate the swing.
   - The robot then swings the hammer at a suitable velocity and direction to hit the apple.

---

### Step 2: Defining constraints

#### **Stage 1: Grasp the hammer**
- **Sub-goal constraint:**
  - The end-effector must align with the hammer handle (keypoint `2`).

#### **Stage 2: Swing the hammer to hit the apple**
- **Sub-goal constraints:**
  - The hammer head (keypoint `4`) should be positioned at a suitable height and distance from the apple (keypoint `0`) before the swing.
  - The hammer should be aligned with the intended swinging direction.

- **Path constraints:**
  - The robot must still be grasping the hammer handle (keypoint `2`).
  - The hammer head (keypoint `4`) should follow a trajectory that ensures it impacts the apple with sufficient force.

---

### Step 3: Summarizing keypoints to be grasped and released

- The robot grasps the hammer handle (keypoint `2`) in stage 1.
- The robot does not need to release the hammer after hitting the apple.
