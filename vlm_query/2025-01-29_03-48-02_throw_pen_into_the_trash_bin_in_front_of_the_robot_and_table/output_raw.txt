### Step 1: Decompose the task into stages
The task "throw pen into the trash bin in front of the robot and table" can be broken down into the following stages:
1. **Grasp the pen**: The robot needs to grasp the pen lying on the table.
2. **Move and reorient pen to a suitable pose to initiate the throw**: The robot needs to align the pen with the intended throwing direction and prepare for the throw.
3. **Swing arm outward at high speed and release the pen at desired speed and position to make it fall into the trash bin**: The robot needs to throw the pen into the trash bin with the correct trajectory.

### Step 2: Constraints for each stage
#### Stage 1: Grasp the pen
- **Spatial sub-goal constraints**:
  - Align the end-effector with the pen (keypoint 3).
- **Dynamic sub-goal constraints**: None.
- **Path constraints**: None.

#### Stage 2: Move and reorient pen to a suitable pose to initiate the throw
- **Spatial sub-goal constraints**:
  - Aim and align the pen with the intended throwing direction (towards the trash bin, keypoint 5).
  - Incurl the arm to prepare for shooting.
- **Dynamic sub-goal constraints**: None.
- **Path constraints**:
  - The robot must still be grasping the pen.

#### Stage 3: Swing arm outward at high speed and release the pen at desired speed and position to make it fall into the trash bin
- **Spatial sub-goal constraints**:
  - Pen is released at a calculated position along a parabolic trajectory, ensuring it falls into the trash bin accurately.
  - Pen is thrown at a 45-degree upward angle.
- **Dynamic sub-goal constraints**:
  - Pen is released at a calculated velocity along a parabolic trajectory, ensuring it falls into the trash bin accurately.
- **Path constraints**:
  - The robot must still be grasping the pen.
  - The pen should keep aligned with the intended throwing direction during execution.

### Keypoints to be grasped and released
- Grasp keypoints: The robot should grasp keypoint 3 (pen).
- Release keypoints: The robot should release keypoint 3 at the end of stage 3.
