# Step 1: Decompose the task into stages/subtasks.
The task is to "throw pen into the trash bin in front of the robot and table, you may use keypoint[4] for pen and keypoint[5] for trash bin".

**Stages:**
1. **Stage 1: Grasp the pen**
   - The robot needs to grasp the pen located at `keypoints[4]`.

2. **Stage 2: Move and reorient pen to a suitable pose to initiate the throw**
   - The robot moves the pen to a position suitable for throwing. This involves moving the end-effector (EEF) to an offset position along the negative of the intended throwing direction to prepare for the throw.

3. **Stage 3: Swing arm outward at high speed and release the pen at desired speed and position to make it fall into the trash bin**
   - The robot swings its arm to throw the pen towards the trash bin (`keypoints[5]`), releasing it at the right position and velocity so that it follows a parabolic trajectory into the bin.

# Step 2: For each stage, reasoning the dynamic system and write constraint functions.

## **Stage 1: Grasp the pen**

**Sub-goal Constraints:**
- **Constraint 1:** The end-effector must be aligned with the pen to grasp it.

   *Mathematical Expression:*
   \[
   \text{cost} = \| \text{eef\_pose} - \text{keypoints}[4] \| - d_{\text{grasp}}
   \]
   Where \(d_{\text{grasp}}\) is a small threshold distance for grasping (e.g., 0.01 meters). The constraint is satisfied when the cost is less than or equal to zero.

**Path Constraints:**
- None for this stage.

## **Stage 2: Move and reorient pen to a suitable pose to initiate the throw**

**Sub-goal Constraints:**

- **Constraint 1:** Move the pen (in EEF) to a position offset along the negative of the throwing direction to prepare for the throw.

   *Calculations:*

   - Calculate the throwing direction unit vector:
     \[
     \mathbf{v}_{\text{dir}} = \frac{\text{keypoints}[5] - \text{keypoints}[4]}{\| \text{keypoints}[5] - \text{keypoints}[4] \|}
     \]
   - Define the desired offset distance \(k\) (e.g., 0.1 meters).
   - Calculate the desired EEF position:
     \[
     \text{desired\_eef\_pose} = \text{keypoints}[4] - k \cdot \mathbf{v}_{\text{dir}}
     \]
   - Formulate the constraint:
     \[
     \text{cost} = \| \text{eef\_pose} - \text{desired\_eef\_pose} \| - \epsilon
     \]
     Where \(\epsilon\) is a small tolerance.

**Path Constraints:**

- **Constraint 1:** The robot must still be grasping the pen.
   - Use `get_grasping_cost_by_keypoint_idx(4)`.

## **Stage 3: Swing arm outward at high speed and release the pen at desired speed and position to make it fall into the trash bin**

**Sub-goal Constraints:**

- **Constraint 1:** The pen is released at a calculated position and velocity so that it follows a parabolic trajectory and lands in the trash bin.

   *Calculations:*

   - Define the displacement components:
     \[
     \Delta x = \text{keypoints}[5][0] - \text{eef\_pose}[0]
     \]
     \[
     \Delta y = \text{keypoints}[5][1] - \text{eef\_pose}[1]
     \]
     \[
     \Delta z = \text{keypoints}[5][2] - \text{eef\_pose}[2]
     \]
   - Compute horizontal distance:
     \[
     \Delta s = \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2}
     \]
   - Compute horizontal velocity magnitude:
     \[
     v_{\text{horizontal}} = \sqrt{\text{eef\_velocity}[0]^2 + \text{eef\_velocity}[1]^2}
     \]
   - Calculate time of flight:
     \[
     t = \frac{\Delta s}{v_{\text{horizontal}} + \epsilon}
     \]
     Where \(\epsilon\) is a small positive value to avoid division by zero.
   - Predict the vertical position at time \(t\):
     \[
     z_{\text{predict}} = \text{eef\_pose}[2] + \text{eef\_velocity}[2] \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
     \]
   - Formulate the constraint:
     \[
     \text{cost} = (z_{\text{predict}} - \text{keypoints}[5][2])^2 - \delta
     \]
     Where \(\delta\) is a small tolerance.

- **Constraint 2:** The initial horizontal velocity vector must be aligned with the displacement vector to the trash bin.

   *Mathematical Expression:*
   \[
   \text{cost} = (\text{eef\_velocity}[0] \cdot \Delta y - \text{eef\_velocity}[1] \cdot \Delta x)^2 - \delta
   \]

- **Constraint 3:** The pen is thrown at a 45-degree upward angle.

   *Calculations:*

   - Calculate total velocity magnitude:
     \[
     v_{\text{magnitude}} = \sqrt{\text{eef\_velocity}[0]^2 + \text{eef\_velocity}[1]^2 + \text{eef\_velocity}[2]^2}
     \]
   - Compute cosine of launch angle \(\theta\):
     \[
     \cos(\theta) = \frac{v_{\text{horizontal}}}{v_{\text{magnitude}} + \epsilon}
     \]
   - Desired cosine value for 45 degrees:
     \[
     \cos(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
     \]
   - Formulate the constraint:
     \[
     \text{cost} = \left( \cos(\theta) - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2 - \delta
     \]

**Path Constraints:**

- **Constraint 1:** The robot must still be grasping the pen until release.
   - Use `get_grasping_cost_by_keypoint_idx(4)`.

- **Constraint 2:** The pen should remain aligned with the intended throwing direction during execution.

   *Mathematical Expression:*
   \[
   \text{cost} = (\text{eef\_velocity}[0] \cdot \Delta y - \text{eef\_velocity}[1] \cdot \Delta x)^2 - \delta
   \]

# Note:
- The small tolerances \(\epsilon\) and \(\delta\) are introduced to avoid division by zero and to set acceptable thresholds for the constraints.
- The gravitational acceleration \(g\) is used in the vertical motion equations.
- Avoided using non-differentiable functions like `abs` by squaring the differences.

# If insufficient information or constraints

<insufficent>
- **Additional Information Needed:**
  - **Mass of the pen:** To accurately model the dynamics of the throw, the mass may influence the required force and velocity.
  - **Size and shape of the trash bin:** To ensure the pen lands inside, dimensions are needed.
  - **Air resistance:** Neglected in calculations but may affect the trajectory in a real scenario.
- **Reasoning:**
  - Precise dynamic calculations require these details to generate accurate constraints and ensure successful task completion.
