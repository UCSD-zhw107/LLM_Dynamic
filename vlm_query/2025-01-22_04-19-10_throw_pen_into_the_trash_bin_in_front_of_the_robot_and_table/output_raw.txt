# To solve this problem, we need to calculate the release point `r` and release velocity `v` such that the pen lands in the trash bin. 
# The following steps outline the solution:

# 1. **Determine the goal position `p`:**
#    The goal position `p` is the center of the trash bin. From the image, the keypoint `5` represents the center of the trash bin. 
#    Therefore, `p = keypoints[5]`.

# 2. **Determine the release point `r`:**
#    The release point `r` should be along the trajectory of the pen, and it should be at a height where the robot can release the pen. 
#    We will assume the release point is slightly above the table and aligned with the direction of the trash bin. 
#    We will calculate `r` as a point between the robot's end-effector position and the trash bin.

# 3. **Calculate the release velocity `v`:**
#    The release velocity `v` must ensure that the pen follows a parabolic trajectory to land in the trash bin. 
#    The velocity vector `v` is angled 45 degrees upwards in the direction of the trash bin. 
#    Using the equations of projectile motion, we can calculate the required velocity components.

#    - Horizontal motion: `v_x` and `v_y` are determined by the distance to the trash bin and the time of flight.
#    - Vertical motion: `v_z` is determined by the upward motion required to reach the trash bin.

# 4. **Equations of motion:**
#    - Time of flight: `t = sqrt(2 * (p_z - r_z) / g)`
#    - Horizontal velocity: `v_xy = sqrt(g * d / sin(2 * theta))`, where `d` is the horizontal distance to the trash bin.
#    - Vertical velocity: `v_z = v_xy * sin(theta)`

# 5. **Constraints:**
#    - The release point `r` must be reachable by the robot.
#    - The release velocity `v` must align with the 45-degree angle constraint.

# Let's calculate `r` and `v` step by step.

def calculate_release_point_and_velocity(end_effector, keypoints, g):
    # Goal position (center of the trash bin)
    p = keypoints[5]
    
    # Release point (slightly above the table and aligned with the trash bin)
    r = end_effector + np.array([0, 0, 0.1])  # Adjusting release point slightly above the table
    
    # Horizontal distance to the trash bin
    d = np.linalg.norm(p[:2] - r[:2])  # Distance in the xy-plane
    
    # Vertical distance to the trash bin
    h = p[2] - r[2]
    
    # Angle of release (45 degrees in radians)
    theta = np.pi / 4
    
    # Time of flight
    t = np.sqrt(2 * h / g)
    
    # Horizontal velocity magnitude
    v_xy = d / t
    
    # Velocity components
    v_x = v_xy * (p[0] - r[0]) / d
    v_y = v_xy * (p[1] - r[1]) / d
    v_z = v_xy  # At 45 degrees, v_z = v_xy
    
    # Release velocity
    v = np.array([v_x, v_y, v_z])
    
    return r, v

# Example usage
# Assuming g = 9.81 m/s^2 (gravitational acceleration)
# end_effector and keypoints are provided by the system
r, v = calculate_release_point_and_velocity(end_effector, keypoints, g)
