# Step 1: Decompose the task into stages/subtasks.

The given task is to "throw pen into the trash bin in front of the robot and table, you may use keypoint[4] for pen and keypoint[5] for trash bin".

We can decompose this task into **3 stages**:

1. **Grasp the pen**.

2. **Move and reorient the pen to a suitable pose to initiate the throw**.

3. **Swing the robot arm outward at high speed and release the pen at the desired speed and position to make it fall into the trash bin**.

# Step 2: For each stage, reason about the dynamic system and write sub-goal and path constraints.

## Stage 1: Grasp the pen

### Sub-goal Constraints:

- **Align the end-effector with the pen (keypoint[4])**: The end-effector should be positioned precisely at the pen's location to grasp it.

### Path Constraints:

- **None**: Grasping is an instantaneous action at the end of this stage.

## Stage 2: Move and reorient the pen to a suitable pose to initiate the throw

### Sub-goal Constraints:

- **Retract the end-effector along the throwing direction to prepare for the throw**: The robot should pull back its arm along the intended throwing direction to gain momentum for the throw.

### Path Constraints:

- **The robot must still be grasping the pen**: The pen must remain grasped throughout this stage.

## Stage 3: Swing the robot arm outward at high speed and release the pen at the desired speed and position to make it fall into the trash bin

### Sub-goal Constraints:

- **Release the pen at a calculated position and velocity to ensure it lands in the trash bin**: The release point and velocity must result in a projectile trajectory that lands the pen in the trash bin.

### Path Constraints:

- **The robot must still be grasping the pen until release**: The pen remains grasped until the release point.
- **The pen should remain aligned with the intended throwing direction during execution**: The pen's orientation should align with the throwing path to ensure accuracy.

# Calculations and Equations

To ensure the pen lands in the trash bin, we need to model the projectile motion and compute the required release velocity and angle.

- **Projectile Motion Equations**:

  - Vertical motion:
    \( \Delta z = v_{0z} t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \)

  - Horizontal motion:
    \( \Delta x = v_{0x} t \)
    \( \Delta y = v_{0y} t \)

- **Constraints**:

  - **Discriminant for Time of Flight**:
    \( \text{discriminant} = v_{0z}^2 - 2 g \Delta z \)

    The discriminant must be non-negative to have real solutions for time.

  - **Landing Position**:
    The horizontal displacement should match the distance to the trash bin:
    \( \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2} = \text{distance to trash bin in XY plane} \)

- **Cost Functions**:

  - Penalize negative discriminant and time:
    Use smooth functions (e.g., softplus) to ensure differentiability.

  - Align the release velocity direction with the throwing direction.

# Grasp and Release Keypoints

- **grasp_keypoints = [4, -1, -1]**: Grasp the pen (keypoint[4]) in stage 1.
- **release_keypoints = [-1, -1, 4]**: Release the pen at the end of stage 3.

- The `get_grasping_cost_by_keypoint_idx(i)` function is assumed to be provided, which returns a cost value indicating if the keypoint `i` is being grasped.
- All cost functions are designed to be differentiable, avoiding non-differentiable operations like `if` statements and `abs`.
